In order to overcome these challenges and improve the effectiveness of RE, we developed REVISE: Requirement Elicitation and Verification Integrated in Social Environment. This tool is designed based on cognitive theories and implementing gamification elements, to motivate collaboration and knowledge sharing between programmers to encourage and enhance the task of RE.
